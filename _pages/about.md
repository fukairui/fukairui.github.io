<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a third-year MS student at the College of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University, under the supervision of Prof. [Kun Kuang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=FOsNiMQAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) and [Shengyu Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=l4Dyt7EAAAAJ&hl=en).

My research primarily focuses on the generalizability and personalization of recommender systems. Recently, I am interested in both recommendations with large language models and the efficient inference of large recommenders when facing much longer user interaction sequences. Meanwhile, I also tackle the distinctive challenges involved in integrating heterogeneous models across diverse computational environments like mobile devices and cloud servers in a seamless and effective manner.

I am currently seeking job opportunities and will graduate in March 2026. If you have any suitable positions, please feel free to reach out.

[RankGR: Rank-Enhanced Generative Retrieval with Listwise Direct Preference Optimization in Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08575v1)

**Kairui Fu\***, Changfa Wu\*, Kun Yuan, Binbin Cao, Dunxian Huang, Yuliang Yan, Junjun Zheng, Jianning Zhang, Silu Zhou, Jian Wu, Kun Kuang

- A rank-enhanced generative retrieval framework for recommendation. Equipped with the listwise direct preference optimization in IAP and the extra scoring module in RSP, RankGR  breaks the limitations of existing methods, particularly their inability to capture hierarchy preference and rich interactions between SIDs and user sequences
- Deployed on Taobao’s "Guess You Like" section, RankGR achieved a 1.08% increase in online item page views and captured 49.88% of total exposures.
